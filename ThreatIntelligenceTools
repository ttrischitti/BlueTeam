Email phishing is one of the main precursors of any cyber attack. Unsuspecting users get duped into opening and accessing malicious files and links sent to them by email, as they appear to be legitimate. As a result, adversaries infect their victimsâ€™ systems with malware, harvesting their credentials and personal data and performing other actions such as financial fraud or conducting ransomware attacks.
