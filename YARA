All about Yara 
"The pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers (and everyone else)" (Virustotal., 2020)

With such a fitting quote, Yara can identify information based on both binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings contained within a file.

Rules are used to label these patterns. For example, Yara rules are frequently written to determine if a file is malicious or not, based upon the features - or patterns - it presents. Strings are a fundamental component of programming languages. Applications use strings to store data such as text.

The proprietary language that Yara uses for rules is fairly trivial to pick up, but hard to master. This is because your rule is only as effective as your understanding of the patterns you want to search for.

Using a Yara rule is simple. Every yara command requires two arguments to be valid, these are:
1) The rule file we create
2) Name of file, directory, or process ID to use the rule for.

Every rule must have a name and condition.

For example, if we wanted to use "myrule.yar" on directory "some directory", we would use the following command:
yara myrule.yar somedirectory
